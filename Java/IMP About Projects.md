Project No.1(Prime No.)               :  Nested If Else 
Problem Statement                     :  Write a Java program for:
                                                   1. Whether a given number prime or not.
                                                   2. To print the pair of prime numbers for given range.
                                   
Project No.2(Complex)                 :  Constructor
Problem Statement                     :  Design a class Complex with data members for real and imaginary part. 
                                         Provide default Parameterized  constructors.  
                                         Write  a  program  to perform  arithmetic  operations  of  two  complex 
                                         numbers.
                         
Project No.3(Student DataBase)        : Class and Object , Array Of Objects
Problem Statement                     : Design a class to store student Info.
                                        Create A array of Objects To store Data Of Multiple Students.
                                 
Project No.4(Constructor Overloading) : static variable and method , array of object, and constructor overloading.
Problem Statement                     : A bag consists of zero or more objects of the same type. Each object can be
                                        described by its color and weight. Design a Java program to create a new
                                        object. This can be done in two ways. If the user provides information about
                                        color and/or weight of the object to be created then this information will be
                                        used to create the object otherwise the object will be created using default
                                        values for these attributes. Provide a facility to keep track of total number of
                                        objects and total weight of object from a bag. Use static variable and
                                        method, array of object, and constructor overloading.
                                        
Project No.5(Inheritance)             : Inheritance , Super keyword , Array of Objects
