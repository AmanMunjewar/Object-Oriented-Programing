Array Of Pointers                    : Array , Pointers , Objects
Problem Statement                    : Create Array of Pointers to assign Objects to those pointers
                                       as we create new objects of class (for e.g StudentDatabase , Employees)
                                       
Friend Function                      : Friend Function , function overloading , constructors
Problem Statement                    : Define two classes to store distance. One of the classes should store distance
                                       in centimeters and meters and other should store distance in feet‚Äôs and
                                       inches. Read two distances, one for each class and compute sum or
                                       differences between them as par the user‚Äôs choice. Display answer in the unit
                                       provided by user. Use friend function, function overloading, constructors
                                       etc.
                                       
Operator Overloading                 : Operator Overloading
Problem Statement                    : Write a program in C++ for the addition of user data type with the build in data type using Operator Overloading concept
                                       Example: 1) obj2 = obj1 + x and 2) obj2 = x + obj1
                                       Note: Both obj1 and obj2 are the objects of same class, and x is a integer value.
